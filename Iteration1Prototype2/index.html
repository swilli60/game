<h2>Game Prototype: Find the Circles!</h2>
<h3>by Scott Williams</h3>
<ul>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
			This is a two-player game. Players share the mouse. Once one of the players clicks the start button, players are faced with a mostly blank screen at first. Each turn, players must make two separate mouse clicks to indicate a line of the area of the game board they wish to reveal. There are four circles with varying point values to be found. The smaller the circle, the higher the point value as well as the difficulty of finding it. Points are only awarded for being the first player to discover a particular circle. Once all circles have been found, the game ends and gives players the choice to click and play again, though that part is a little glitchy. Reloading the page is best after completing a game.
